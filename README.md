# Logistic_regression_from_scratch
## I used the andrew ng course lecture slides as reference to build it from scratch.
## Steps taken:
#### 1. I used the mnist dataset from sklearn datasets
#### 2. i first trained the sklearn logistic regression function.
#### 3. i founnd out the confustion matrix and accuracy.
#### 4. then i made the cost function, the activation/sigmoid function, hypothesis function, the cost function derivative, the gradient descent function
#### 5. I made 10 different dictionaries having binary values telling whether the datapoints are of that class or not.
#### 6. I made 10 different theta matrixes for each of the binary classification.
#### 7. passing theta of a certain class and any data point into the hypothesis function that finds the probablity that the datapoint is of that respective class.Finding the probablities for each of the 10 classes for the same data point we can get the maximum probablity bearing class as the class the data point belongs to.
